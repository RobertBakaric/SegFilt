SegFilt version 1.0
=======================

NAME:

SEG Filter


DESCRIPTION:


This is a c++ implementation of SEG program written by Wootton and Federhen made for identifying and masking segments of low
complexity in amino acid sequences. 



SYNOPSIS:
    
    #include<string>
    #include<SegFilt.hpp>

    string ProtSeq = "VGRGVQIGSPHHHHHHHHHHPQPATYQTSGNLGVSYSHSSCGPSYGSQNFSAPYSPYALNQEADVSGGYPQCAPAVYSGNLSSPMVQHHHHHQGYAGGAVGSPQYIHHSYGQEHQSLALATYN";

/* Make object */

    /* Construction */
    SEG<int> seg;
    /*  OR  */
    SEG<int> seg(arg); // arg is : unordered_map<string, int|long|unsigned|double>


/*  Functions */


    string mask = seg.SegFilt(ProtSeq);   
    //mask =  VGRGVQIGSPxxxxxxxxxxPQPATYQTSGNLGVSYSHSSCGPSYGSQNFSAPYSPYALNQEADVSGGYPQCAPAVYSGNLSSPMVxxxxxxxGYAGGAVGSPQYIHHSYGQEHQSLALATYN
